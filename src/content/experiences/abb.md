# title

**Lead Developer** and **Momentary Architect** at **ABB Robotics**

# intro

Lead the development and reformation of the micro front end for ABB Robotics' next-generation IoT platform, alongside initiating an end-to-end department-wide architectural redesign.

The project had faced critical challenges, rooted in a substantial backlog of volatile architectural decisions. The front end therefore had both large technical debt but also a high level of complex responsibilities given the array of challenges with the IoT services and their APIs.

# efforts

- **Reform the micro front-end architecture**: Align with best practices and Functional Programming principles to build a simple yet extensible design pattern, creating headway in how React Query can be used with complex dependent requests and real time sockets in a large micro front end.
- **Launched System-Wide Architectural Overhaul**: Responded to system architects' concerns over foundational flaws in the IoT architecture by leading the design and presentation of a new, UNIX Philosophy-inspired architecture. This approach emphasized modularity, utilizing a policy mechanism for separating concerns across independent services.
- **Resolve DevOps complexity**: Refine how all dependent web apps, services and libraries are built, delivered and connected as well as improving the local developer experience. Working with Azure Pipelines, Docker and Rollup.
- **Web Services Enhancement**: Advanced the authentication mechanisms in the Express.js server, improving security, feature set and user experience.
- **Development Guidelines**: Established shared programming guidelines to refine peer review, technical decision-making, and collaboration processes.

# results

- **Enhanced Performance and UX**: Achieved significant reductions in code complexity and app load times (10x faster), and minimized side effects (4x less), facilitating real-time updates.
- **Enable and deliver major features**: Through the reformation enable and add the support for and implement a new extensive feature requested from stakeholders.
- **Architectural redesign proposal accepted**: The solution to solving the platforms foundational instability was successfully received by architects and management. Redefining their approach to IoT web services.

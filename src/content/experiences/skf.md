# title

**Front End Lead** for **SKF**

# intro

Enhanced SKF's IoT platformâ€™s app for integrations. Delivered features and tackled rising technical debt, instability, and bugs that hindered the backend-focused team's ability to effectively deliver on a substantial backlog of full-stack features.

# efforts

- **Front end architectural reformation**: Adhere to Functional Design Principles valued by the chosen tech stack of *React*, *Redux* and *Reselect*.
- **New features and reformation in parallel**: Successfully leverage new features in parallel with the architectural reformation through a structured bite sized approach.

 
# results

- **From backlog to surplus**: Resolve all front-end technical debt, instability and bugs while doubling the amount of user functionality.
- **Architecture design pattern**: Create a simple, clear and coherent design pattern for the React app, easing maintainability, stability, performance, and future feature development:
  - **50% reduction in codebase size** despite doubling number of features.
  - Significantly cut the backend focused team's overhead to deliver new full-stack functionality.

intro: |
  Jonas's interest in UNIX, Emacs and Linux has been a cornerstone of his 7-year career in web development. He is a self-taught developer with a technically deep background, demonstrated through his contributions in various domains:
  
  He has developed and led the architectural design of web services, worked with Dev Ops, made Linux services, and worked with audio electronics. In the realm of front-end development, Jona has pioneered innovative solutions within the React ecosystem, going behind the scenes and bringing new features with focus on data-practices, performance and maintainability.
  
  Jona is equally enthusiastic about backend development and embedded systems, despite his primary career focus on front-end projects. He openly embraces opportunities in these areas with strong interest.

  In addition to being a talented developer, Jona is structured, easy to communicate with and often brings enthusiasm and positive energy to the team.

      The project had faced critical challenges, rooted in a substantial backlog of volatile architectural decisions. The front end therefore had both large technical debt but also a high level of complex responsibilities given the array of challenges with the IoT services and their APIs.
    efforts: |
      - **Reform the micro front-end architecture**: Align with best practices and Functional Programming principles to build a simple yet extensible design pattern, creating headway in how React Query can be used with complex dependent requests and real time sockets in a large micro front end.
      - **Launched System-Wide Architectural Overhaul**: Responded to system architects' concerns over foundational flaws in the IoT architecture by leading the design and presentation of a new, UNIX Philosophy-inspired architecture. This approach emphasized modularity, utilizing a policy mechanism for separating concerns across independent services.
      - **Resolve DevOps complexity**: Refine how all dependent web apps, services and libraries are built, delivered and connected as well as improving the local developer experience. Working with Azure Pipelines, Docker and Rollup.
      - **Web Services Enhancement**: Advanced the authentication mechanisms in the Express.js server, improving security, feature set and user experience.
